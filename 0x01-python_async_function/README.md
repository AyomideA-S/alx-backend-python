## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows for the execution of tasks without blocking the main program flow. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of asynchronous programming.
- Learn how to use `async` and `await` keywords.
- Implement asynchronous functions using `asyncio`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `asyncio` library

## Projects

1. **Basic Async Function**: Implement a simple asynchronous function.
2. **Async Comprehensions**: Use asynchronous comprehensions to handle asynchronous iterators.
3. **Parallel Coroutines**: Run multiple coroutines in parallel.
