## Introduction

Variable annotations in Python allow you to add type hints to your variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps in improving code clarity and can assist with debugging and development.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose of variable annotations.
- Learn how to use type hints in Python.
- Practice writing functions with type hints.
- Explore the benefits of type checking.

## Project Structure

- `0-add.py`: A function that adds two integers.
- `1-concat.py`: A function that concatenates two strings.
- `2-floor.py`: A function that returns the floor of a float.
- `3-to_str.py`: A function that converts a float to a string.
- `4-define_variables.py`: Examples of variable annotations.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, use the following command:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to execute.
